# 2. Backtesting: 

backtesting is a process of using historical data to test the performance of a trading strategy and make adjustments as needed. By simulating the execution of a strategy on historical data, traders can evaluate the strategy's potential profitability, risk profile, and other key metrics.

You can backtest your trading strategy by running it on historical data and comparing the simulated results to the actual outcomes. For example, you could use historical data from the Binance exchange to simulate the execution of your trading strategy over a certain period of time, and compare the simulated profits or losses to the actual outcomes.

To do backtesting in your code you can use a library such as Backtrader, which allows you to test strategies using historical data and evaluate performance using various metrics.
Another option is to use a data provider such as CryptoDataDownload, which provides historical data from various crypto exchanges.

It is important to note that backtesting has its limitations such as survivorship bias, lookahead bias and market conditions change. Therefore, traders should take the results of backtesting with a grain of salt and use it as a tool to evaluate the strategy, but also test it on live market conditions as well.

# The Code: 
In this example, the MyStrategy class is a subclass of the Backtrader Strategy class, which is similar to the previous example. The __init__ method initializes a simple moving average (SMA) indicator with a period of 20, and the next method checks the current price against the SMA to determine if it should buy or sell.

The Cerebro class is the main engine of Backtrader and it's used to set up and run the backtest. In this example, the strategy is added to the cerebro instance, and the historical data is added to it via the adddata method.

At this point two analyzers are added: Returns analyzer to calculate the profit and loss of the strategy, and the SQN analyzer to calculate the system quality number.

You can use the run method to run the backtest and evaluate the performance of the strategy.

The results variable will contain a list of all the strategies that ran, in this case, there will only be one strategy, so you can access the analyzers of that strategy by using results[0].analyzers.

You can use the get_analysis method of the analyzers to get the calculated values, for example, the get_analysis method of the Returns analyzer returns a dictionary with the net profit, gross profit, gross loss, etc.

You can also use the plot method of cerebro to generate a visual representation of the backtest results, it's a powerful tool to analyze the performance of the strategy.
