# 4. Portfolio management: 

This is a pretty long and varible topic, wo I will use two examples.

Portfolio management is an important aspect of trading. Diversifying your portfolio by trading multiple assets, rather than just a single one, can help to spread risk and potentially increase returns.

One way to diversify your portfolio is to trade different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities. For example, if you are only trading Bitcoin, you could add Ethereum, Litecoin, and other cryptocurrencies to your portfolio. This will help to spread your risk across multiple assets, rather than having all of your money tied up in one asset.

Another way to diversify your portfolio is to trade different markets, such as the US stock market, the Chinese stock market, and the Japanese stock market. This will also help to spread your risk across different regions and markets.

When incorporating portfolio management it's also important to consider the correlation between the assets you are trading. Correlation measures the degree to which two assets move in relation to each other. If the assets have a high correlation, it means that they move in the same direction and the diversification benefits will be reduced.

It's also important to have a strategy for managing and rebalancing your portfolio over time. This might involve selling positions that have grown too large and buying positions that have become underweighted. Additionally, it's important to consider the risk level of each position in the portfolio, to ensure that it aligns with your overall risk tolerance.

Here is an example of how you could modify the initial code to implement portfolio management.

This modified code will trade multiple assets, specified in the symbols list, rather than just a single one. The code gets the current prices for all symbols, and the free balance for each symbol's base currency, and then it iterates through each symbol and checks if the current price is below or above the thresholds. If the price is below the buy threshold, it places a buy order for the corresponding base currency and if it is above the sell threshold it places a sell order for the corresponding base currency.

It's important to note that this code is just an example, and there are many other ways to implement portfolio management in your trading bot. Additionally, it's important to note that using a single threshold for all symbols may not be the best approach, and it's better to use different thresholds for different symbols based on their volatility, liquidity and other factors.

Here's an example of a simple portfolio management strategy that trades multiple assets.

This code defines a target allocation for each asset in the portfolio and checks if the current allocation deviates from the target allocation. If the current allocation is higher than the target allocation for a given asset, it sells the asset in order to bring the allocation back in line with the target. If the current allocation is lower than the target allocation for a given asset, it buys the asset in order to bring the allocation back in line with the target. It is important to note that this is a simple example, in practice you will need to implement more complex logic, such as risk management, to make sure that you are trading in a safe and responsible way.
