# 5. Market sentiment analysis

Market sentiment analysis is a method of using external data, such as news articles or social media sentiment, to inform trading decisions. This can be done by analyzing the tone of news articles or social media posts related to a specific asset or market, or by tracking metrics such as the number of mentions of a specific asset or keyword. By analyzing this data, traders can gain insight into the overall sentiment of the market or the sentiment towards a specific asset, which can inform their trading decisions. Some examples of sentiment analysis techniques that could be used in a trading bot include natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the tone of news articles or social media posts, or sentiment analysis using machine learning algorithms to classify the sentiment of a large dataset of news articles or social media posts.

Here's an example of how we could incorporate market sentiment analysis into our trading bot. 
In this example, we added a new function get_market_sentiment(symbol) that makes an API call to a sentiment analysis service and returns the sentiment (Bullish or Bearish) for the given symbol. We then incorporated this sentiment into our trading strategy by only placing a buy order if the current price is below the buy threshold and the sentiment is Bullish, and by placing a sell order if the current price is above the sell threshold or the sentiment is Bearish.

Keep in mind that this is just an example and there are many other ways to incorporate market sentiment analysis into your trading bot and that you may need to adjust the sentiment values to your needs.
