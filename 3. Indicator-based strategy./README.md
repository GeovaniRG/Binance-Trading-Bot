# 3. Indicator-based strategy: 

Incorporating technical indicators such as moving averages or relative strength index (RSI) into your trading strategy can help to generate more accurate buy and sell signals.

For example, a moving average is a widely used indicator that calculates the average price of an asset over a certain period of time (e.g. 50 days). You can use the moving average to identify trends in the asset's price, and generate buy and sell signals based on the relationship between the current price and the moving average. If the current price is above the moving average, it may be a signal to buy, and if the current price is below the moving average, it may be a signal to sell.

Another popular indicator is the relative strength index (RSI), which compares the magnitude of recent gains to recent losses in an attempt to determine overbought and oversold conditions of an asset. Values of RSI that are above 70 are considered to be overbought and may indicate a potential sell opportunity, while values of RSI that are below 30 are considered to be oversold and may indicate a potential buy opportunity.

It's important to keep in mind that these are just examples of how indicators can be used, and there are many other indicators available that can be incorporated into a trading strategy. Additionally, it's also important to be aware that indicators are based on past data, so it's always good to combine them with other analysis tools and to use them in conjunction with other strategies such as risk management.

We  incorporate technical indicators like moving averages or RSI into your trading strategy. You can use the ta-lib library which is a widely used library for technical analysis in Python.
