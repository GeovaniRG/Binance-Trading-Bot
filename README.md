# Binance-trading-bot
Small Python Trading boot

This script uses the ccxt library to interact with the Binance exchange. It defines a simple trading strategy where it will buy BTC when the price falls below 90% of the current price and sell when the price rises above 110% of the current price. It does this by repeatedly calling the trading_strategy function in a loop.
