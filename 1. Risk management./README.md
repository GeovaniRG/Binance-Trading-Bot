# 1. Risk management:

- Stop-loss

To implement a stop-loss order in this trading bot, you would need to add a few lines of code to the trading strategy function. A stop-loss order is an order that is placed to automatically sell an asset when it reaches a certain price, in order to limit potential losses.

Here, we've added a variable called stop_loss_price which is defined as the current price * 0.8. This means that if the price of BTC/USDT drops below 80% of the current price, a stop-loss order will be placed to automatically sell the BTC.

It's important to note that the ccxt library doesn't have built-in support for stop-loss orders, you might need to use a different library or write your own code to place stop-loss orders using the Binance API.

- Take-profit

To implement a take-profit order in this trading bot, you would need to add a few lines of code to the trading strategy function. A take-profit order is an order that is placed to automatically sell an asset when it reaches a certain price, in order to lock in profit.

Here, we've added a variable called take_profit_price which is defined as the current price * 1.2. This means that if the price of BTC/USDT rises above 120% of the current price, a take-profit order will be placed to automatically sell the BTC.

As with the stop-loss order, it's important to note that the ccxt library doesn't have built-in support for take-profit orders, and you might need to use a different library or write your own code to place take-profit orders using the Binance API.
Also bear in mind that this is just an example and you should adjust the take-profit price according to your own risk management strategy, and test it before using it in live trading.
