# 7. Incorporating a database to save historical data and make trading decisions based on historical data.

ncorporating a database to save historical data and make trading decisions based on historical data is a good way to improve the performance of your trading bot. By storing historical data such as past prices, volumes, and order book data, you can analyze trends, calculate technical indicators, and make more informed trading decisions.

To implement this, you would need to choose a database system and a library to interact with the database in python, such as SQLite or MySQL with the library sqlalchemy.

You would then need to modify your trading strategy function to store relevant data in the database, such as the current price, the buy and sell thresholds, the number of coins bought or sold, and the time of the trade. You could also store the historical data of prices, volumes, and order book data.

You would then need to query the database to retrieve historical data and use it to make trading decisions, such as analyzing trends in historical prices to set buy and sell thresholds or calculating technical indicators like moving averages or RSI.

An example of how you might implement this is by setting up a SQLite database and using the sqlalchemy library to interact with it. Here is an example of how you might create a table to store your trades:

```
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class Trade(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'trades'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    timestamp = Column(String)
    symbol = Column(String)
    side = Column(String)
    price = Column(String)
    amount = Column(String)

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///trades.db')
Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
```
Then you can use this table to insert data every time you make a trade and you can use the same engine to make queries to the database to retrieve data.

Keep in mind that depending on the size of the historical data and the frequency of trades, the database could become large and you might need to optimize it or use a more performant solution like a distributed database like Apache Cassandra or Amazon DynamoDB.
